      <i>The Amazing Guitar Demystifier</i> is a tool that can help you learn and master the
      secrets of the guitar!  Use it to build custom chords.  Use it to help you practice scale patterns all 
      over the fretboard. Use it in your study of music theory, as an aid to help you read music.
      As you use it, the fundamental patterns that underlies everything you ever play 
      will impress themselves upon your mind, eventually becoming second nature to you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to figure out a new way to play a chord, just consult the 
      <a href="chords.html">Handy-Dandy Chords Reference.</a>  Pick your reference (root) note
      and plug the scale-degrees on the reference page into the Demystifier.  To get an idea of
      how this works, plug in the note "E" and scale degrees 1, 3, and 5.  This will give you the
      full pattern of the E-Major chord on the guitar.  Notice the familiar E chord
      pattern down at the 0 fret.  It's that simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are practicing scales, consult the <a href="scales.html">Handy-Dandy Scales Reference</a>.
      Pick your key and plug in the scale-degrees from the reference.  Play the scale starting from
      scale-degree 1, anywhere on the fretboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you are working with chords and scales, you are going to notice some that interesting 
      patterns emerge.  <i>Experiment!</i>  Play the patterns and see what they sound like. That 
      is really what this tool is designed for - experimentation.  Given time, you will see the guitar
      in a whole new way.

      Welcome to a larger world, my friend!
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>The Amazing Guitar Demystifier</i> is based on the teaching styles of Richard Daniels, 
      the author of, among other works, <a href="recommended.html#heavyguitarbible"><b>The Heavy Guitar Bible</b></a>. 
      He routinely uses diagrams of the guitar fretboard to show you how to play up, down, and all around the
      neck.  This application is really just a generalized extension of that idea.
      See our <a href="recommended.html">recommendations</a> for this and other books and learning materials that can help you
      master the guitar.

      <b>Colors and Notes</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The chromatic colors can be helpful for understanding the relationships between scale-degrees
      in a chord, but they can be a distraction if you are working with scales.  Chromatic colors
      can be toggled on and off in the <i>Options</i> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can change the color of any scale-degree to gray.  This allows you to distinguish 
      "extra" notes, such as when you add the flatted-5<sup>th</sup> to the Blues Scale, or 
      when you combine the notes of the Pentatonic Minor and Pentatonic Major into a single scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole notes (A - G) will be displayed on the fretboard by default.  You can optionally turn them
      off if you would rather just work with the scale-degree patterns and ignore the notes.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      <b>Printing</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Print the <i>Demystifier</i> web page.  Just do it.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.
      All the clutter on the left side of the web page is removed, and you are left with just
      the fretboard diagram and scale-degree information, which is what you were really after in
      the first place, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      You can specify a <i>Title</i> and <i>Subtitle</i> for the printout.  The <i>Title</i> should
      contain a description of the scale or chord (like "Diminished Chord"). The <i>Subtitle</i>
      may contain additional information, such as the scale-degrees (like "1, -3, -5").  This is 
      particularly helpful when you are using scale degrees that go above 7 (9, 11, and 13 are common).
    </p>

      <b>Browser Support</b>
    </p>  
    <p>
      If you are having trouble viewing the web page, it may be because you are using an incompatible 
      browser.  The <i>Demystifier</i> is written for and tested with Internet Explorer, versions 6 
      and up.  It uses some features of Internet Explorer that are not implemented in other browsers.
      If you are viewing this web page with a browser other than Internet Explorer, and it actually 
      works, you are very lucky!
